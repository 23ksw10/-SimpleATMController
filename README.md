# SimpleATMController


## Requirements

At least the following flow should be implemented:
Insert Card => PIN number => Select Account => See Balance/Deposit/Withdraw
For simplification, there are only 1 dollar bills in this world, no cents. Thus account balance can be represented in integer.


## How to run

Compile the test.cpp by C/C++. The program can be conducted through console with some sample bank operation provided.
